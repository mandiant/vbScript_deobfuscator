really complex, but seems to be working quite well.
about 12hrs in now.

First click indent, then click rename

you can double click or hit space on names in the listviews
to rename them from the defaults.

if you do rename them manually, its up to you to make sure
you dont create conflicts. I am to lazy to add these checks
right now.

select an item in teh list and hit 'd' to keep its default name
